 *
 * This is what makes the main campaign-generation pipeline fact-grounded: the onboarding
 * deep-research path extracts facts as a side effect of analyzeProduct/analyzeAudience
 * (modules/onboarding/analysis.ts), but the research-orchestrator path only persists pages,
 * so without this step the fact-grounded agents (creative/campaign/critic) would always see
 * an empty facts list for pipeline-generated campaigns.
 *
 * Returns the number of facts persisted. 0 (never a throw upward from missing data) when
 * the crawl has no pages or no model is configured — real facts or none, no fallback facts.
