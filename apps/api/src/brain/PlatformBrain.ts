/**
 * The platform's unifying reasoning core — the one named entry point for "given research
 * on a business, think," rather than each caller re-deriving this same concurrency by
 * hand. Runs the Decision Engine, the 3-engine Intelligence Enrichment pass, and the
 * 20-agent Coordinator concurrently off one shared ResearchContext (same input,
 * independent outputs — none of the three depends on either of the others' results) and
 * returns them combined.
 *
 * This exact concurrency previously lived inline inside campaignGenerationPipeline.ts;
 * extracting it here doesn't change *when* anything runs relative to the rest of that
 * pipeline (fact extraction and CompanyKnowledgeBuilder still finish first, sequentially,
 * before think() is called — see that file's own comments on why) — it gives the platform
 * one reusable, independently-testable place to call for "think," so a second pipeline, a
 * chat-style assistant, or a debug tool that wants to re-run just the reasoning step
 * doesn't need to reconstruct this ordering itself.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes: crawl fact extraction and CompanyKnowledgeBuilder (must finish
 * BEFORE this runs, not concurrently with it), and everything Phase-3-shaped in campaign
 * generation (strategy/campaign building, recommendation persistence) — those consume
 * *this* function's output, they aren't part of the thinking itself. Onboarding's
 * deep-research path (modules/onboarding/analysis.ts) is intentionally NOT routed through
 * here — it's a fully separate, disjoint context shape (ProductAnalysis/AudienceAnalysis,
 * not ResearchContext); unifying it would mean redesigning that path's own data model, not
 * just wiring it through this function, so it stays out of scope for now.
 *
 * Failure posture mirrors what campaignGenerationPipeline.ts already did: the Decision
 * Engine and Intelligence Enrichment are "enhancement, not hard dependency" — a failure in
 * either degrades to null / an empty result and is logged, never thrown. The Agent
 * Coordinator is the one hard dependency (campaign generation cannot proceed without at
 * least the campaign-agent's result), so its failure propagates to the caller unchanged.
