/**
 * Closes the creative-fatigue loop. Detection (creativeFatigueDetector) and regeneration
 * (optimizationEngine → creativeGenerationQueue) already run automatically, but before this the
 * freshly generated creative just landed "for review" — a human still had to swap it into the live
 * ad. That's the gap vs. AdsGo's "auto-rotate creative on fatigue". This module performs the swap:
 * the fatigued ad is paused and a NEW ad carrying the fresh creative is created in the SAME ad set,
 * so targeting/budget/optimization history on the ad set are preserved and only the creative rotates.
 *
 * Only Meta is wired today (the live hierarchy adapter). Google/others are skipped rather than
 * silently half-swapped. Best-effort and idempotent-ish: it no-ops if the variant isn't a launched
 * Meta ad or the job produced no usable creative, and never throws into the worker.
