 * Compatibility facade for the ~20 call sites (agents/support.ts, several modules/*
 * services, several research/* engines) that predate llmRouter.ts's per-task provider
 * routing and always called the chat/text/search/embedding functions directly, with no
 * task-specific model assignment. Rather than migrate every one of those onto llmRouter.ts +
 * llmTaskConfig.ts (a much larger, separately-scoped change), this module keeps the same
 * function names/shapes, backed by Claude via Amazon Bedrock — the single LLM provider the
 * whole pipeline now depends on.
 *
 * runStructured/runText route through llmRouter.ts with a "bedrock" assignment so these call
 * sites share the exact same dispatch (usage boundary, error handling) as the router-based
 * callers, no call-site changes needed.
 *
 * One capability not wired here:
 *  - Image generation: see modules/generation/imageProvider.ts (Google Imagen / Stability /
 *    mock) — a separate subsystem, not routed through this facade.
 * Embeddings (Research Memory / RAG) are backed by Bedrock Titan Text Embeddings V2.
 * Live web search is backed by SearXNG + crawl4ai — see runWebSearch below.

 * SearXNG search (searchTaskConfig.ts assigns this the "web-research" task) followed by a
 * crawl4ai content-enrichment pass. This two-stage design matters for research QUALITY:
 * SearXNG returns only a one-line result blurb per hit (a search-engine snippet), which is far
 * thinner grounding than the paragraph of extracted page text Tavily used to return in this
 * same field. To restore deep grounding, the top results' URLs are crawled with crawl4ai (self-
 * hosted, no per-call quota) IN PARALLEL, and each hit's narrative uses the real page content
 * when the crawl succeeds, falling back to the SearXNG snippet when it doesn't. So a hit's
 * grounding is: full page markdown (best) -> SearXNG snippet (fine) -> title only (worst).
 *
 * `prompt` here is a full instructional research sentence (e.g. "Research the main named
 * competitors of the business at X..."), passed to SearXNG as-is rather than distilled into a
 * shorter query first (that would cost an extra LLM call per search on an already-short prompt).
 *
 * Degrades to the same empty result on any outage (SearXNG unreachable / no results) the old
 * no-op returned; enrichment failing (crawl4ai down) never blocks the search — every caller's
 * fallback path (support.ts's webSearchThenStructure, the Intelligence Engines' own
 * runWebSearch calls) already handles the empty shape and needs no changes.
